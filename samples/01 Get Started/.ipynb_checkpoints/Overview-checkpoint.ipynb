    "\n",
    "These samples demonstrate various features of the ArcGIS Python API. The samples are categorized by the user profile they are most relevant to. Each sample is in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html), that can be viewed online, or downloaded and run interactively. See the Getting Started section in the Guide to learn how to download and run the sample notebooks on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample notebooks contain Python code along with narrative text and rich media (images, videos, widgets, etc). The result of code execution is captured and presented along with the code, using rich media representations. This makes the notebook format a great way to record the steps of your analysis, and present and share the results of your analysis with others.\n",
